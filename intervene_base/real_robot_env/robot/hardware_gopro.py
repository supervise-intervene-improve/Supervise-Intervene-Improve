class GoPro(ContinuousCamera):
    """
    This implementation only works with **GoPro Hero 9 Black** and acts as a workaround for the following issue: https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-py-api/issues/184
    
    TLDR: When sending a request to the GoPro to record a video/take a photo, the GoPro disconnects the USB connection.

    Usage:
    1. Connect GoPro to PC through USB.
    2. Find GoPro interface and IP and create `GoPro` instance (`GoPro.get_devices()`).
    3. Start recording (`gopro.start_recording()`).
       - After receiving the request, the GoPro disconnects until recording is stopped.
    4. After calling `gopro.stop_recording()`, manually stop recording on GoPro (you have 30s).
       - GoPro reconnects to computer, now with a different interface and IP.
       - `stop_recording` waits until it finds a suitable interface and IP and reconnects to it.
    5. Store (`gopro.store_recording(filename)`) or discard (`gopro.delete_recording()`) recording.
    6. At the end of use, close the connection (`gopro.close()`).

    Also only works, when only one GoPro is connected, due to bug above.
